# python__dice-rolling-game
This is a dice rolling game, written in Python. 

    So the question is ... 
        If a player rolls 2, 6 sided dice 1000 times.
        What number will the 2 dice sum to most often, 
        and what is the expected frequency of this number?
    
    To win the game, 
        a) predict the correct number that the 2 dice will most likely sum to and,
        b) correctly predict the frequency of rolls at this number. 
    To play, take your best guess, run the program, and see if you were correct!    
   
    Note that, the 2 dice are generated and 
    the results and frequencies data is visualized and analyzed 
    in diceRollingGame__.html
